From:: fortuna (ROOM #013)

Subject:: "Finally found it!"

Message Contents::
 
"Hey, it's fortuna, like the subject says I finally found, well... kinda found
one part of that textbook I mentioned a while ago. Pretty good introductory 
stuff, gets more in depth later from what I can remember. Haven't found the
title or cover pages yet, thing got into a freak accident with my ceiling fan
a few years ago. When I find it, (and the rest, obviously), I'll upload it
here. I know you all were looking for some more informational stuff to start
the new collection, so I'll be tearing my place apart looking for it. 
 
I'll be in touch."

PREFACE

"In the spaces between her fingernail and flesh, bumping our heads on keratin
and capillaries, clinging desperately onto her eyelashes, praying for a staring
contest, sinking deep into her cells, stringing hammocks on actin tubules... 
all of these places, at all times, in various states of awareness and joy,
this... is where we seem to always find ourselves."

-excerpt of a speech delivered at biomeU on the world-seed by Ragna DiMarina, 
 biome meta-analyst, PhD.

This quote from Dr. DiMarina has remained infamous amongst biome's scholars,
for good reason. As provocative and seemingly mystic the claim, all depictions of
the data-world have fallen in line with this theoretical model. biome's earliest
recorded depictions have revealed the repitition of a similar figure, loosely
overlain onto this world's ever-changing topography. It is this figure, this girl,
that Dr. DiMarina had called out so clearly, that was waiting for people to look
at her. 

biome had been looked at, and was content to look back on us. Professionals and
amateurs from all fields, all levels, started seeing her in their manuscripts, 
seeing her in their spreadsheets, seeing her in their microscopes, planetariums 
and ledgers, seeing her beyond reason and in a way too familiar to call
hallucination... She stared, like a child at a strange bug, direct to the 
collective. No individual to report a separate message, no individual perceived.
At once, this world's residents saw their world-neighbors, time dropped its
linear mask, ghosts and angels danced hand in hand with foxes and rabbits, S and 
P orbitals altered their shape, forming little irises and grins, cataclysmic
in implication, but in execution, harmless. total rearrangement of (at least 
one) reality, calm and asymptomatic, save for a "strong plum smell"...

This is how most of biome's contemporary scholars believe the purple week began.
Affected individuals, (including Dr. DiMarina herself) lost most of their memories
surrounding the event, but video recordings along with plum-ink journal entries 
indicate a kind of universal giddiness, unflinching and total in its scope.

A wild plum obsession swept the population, dreams and cravings alike, frenzied
purple harvests, eyes rolling back and hands clasping blindly, every silly soul
dashing sense away, lost in the chase of plum pudding, sugar plums, plum 
sandwiches,plum bodywash, plum casseroles, plum omelets, plum syrup across plum
waffles...

Since that week, a distinct caution around engaging with biome's truer forms
has been advised by leading scholars. It seemed that while the plums were enjoyed
by all, a certain nose-blindness set in, old instincts took over, and "business 
as usual" returned without delay, question, or regret. The world was different, 
crossed-over endlessly with little folds of other realities and illusions,
inseparable and inconsequential from the "consensus". Conceptions of material had
been shaken to their core, and the assumed base logic along with most constants 
across the data-world became upturned (not to mention made multiple magnitudes 
of infinite supersets more complex by the discarding of linear time in revelation
of a more rhizomatic model in combination with the "side-stepping" methods
popularized by the swamp's more ancient pseudo-sentients in collusion with the
hyper-material heretical sight willows (heretical from the older times, generally
dismissed as "know-it-alls" before the discovery of time's true nature here)). 

biome, as inhabited, is, was, and will be realized to be this. It can be a
daunting journey to get a grasp on the ins-and-outs for a newcomer.

This textbook seeks to coalesce the through-lines of biome, what appears
consistent to those who encounter it across worlds and across times. Due to its
nebulous and odd nature, the goal of total comprehension of biome's core essence 
is frankly unreasonable, but this shall not stop the authors from showing what 
can be shown, as close as possible, to what is judged as some sort of commonality 
across this wondrous, beautiful plane.

  <h3>what is biome?</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>biome is a web project that focuses on roleplay, creation, and collaboration. it's a world with its own lore, locations, mechanics, and creatures, which are all realized by its contributors.</p>
  <p>my goal with biome is to create an ecosystem of materials and artists that work together to  populate this world. i want to encourage interactivity and participation.</p>

  <h3>what can i submit?</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>we are taking submissions for the <a href="/laboratory/ffindex">fauna/flora index</a>.</p>

  <h3>how do i get on the phone book?</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>the phone book is for resident creators. i made it as a way to credit frequent contributors of biome. if you'd like to work more closely with what's going on here, please feel free to reach out at <a href="mailto:mailbox@biome.zip">mailbox@biome.zip</a>. otherwise, contributors are usually credited on individual project pages.</p>
